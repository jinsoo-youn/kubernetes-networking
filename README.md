## Introduction to Kubernetes Networking

Kubernetes networking is a crucial aspect of cluster setup and management. This guide covers the fundamentals of Kubernetes networking and dives into various CNI plugins that can be used to manage network policies and connectivity within a Kubernetes cluster.

## CNI Plugins

### Calico

Calico is a popular CNI plugin that provides network security through network policies and high performance through optimized data plane operations. It supports a range of networking options and is widely used in production environments.

### Cilium

Cilium is a powerful CNI plugin that focuses on providing secure network connectivity and load balancing for cloud-native applications using BPF and XDP technologies. It enables deep visibility and security in the network layer.

### Other CNI Plugins

In addition to Calico and Cilium, there are several other CNI plugins available for Kubernetes, each with its unique features and use cases. This guide also includes information on these plugins to help you choose the right solution for your needs.

## Getting Started

To get started with Kubernetes networking and CNI plugins, follow the setup instructions provided in the [setup guide](./docs/setup.md). Each section includes detailed steps and configuration examples to help you configure your Kubernetes cluster with the desired CNI plugin.

## Best Practices

This repository also covers best practices for Kubernetes networking, including tips on optimizing performance, securing network traffic, and managing network policies effectively.

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter any issues while setting up or managing Kubernetes networking, refer to the [troubleshooting guide](./docs/troubleshooting.md) for common problems and their solutions.
